# Hello world
This page is generated from `.md` files using [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/). The rest of this document describes the motivation, ideas and learnings around this process.

## Pandoc and Markdown
[Markdown](https://google.com?q=markdown) is a text format that is helpful for authoring in general. [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) is a tool that understands multiple document formats and allows people to convert documents between those formats.

## GNU Make
[Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) is a tool for working with source files, generally used in C/C++ codebases but not limited to that domain. It has a rich set of features that reduce the amount of code required for complicated build graphs.

# Goals
The following are the main goals selected for this blogging system

1. Use the minimum amount of code that is reasonable for each task
2. Don't reinvent the wheel. Use standard tools instead
3. Have fun!

# Next steps
The next posts in this series will cover how the blogging system works including links to the code and snippets in case you are interested in borrowing some ideas. Feel free to copy/paste or fork the [repo](https://github.com/arcmode/arcmode.github.io).
