# Hi there

I'm a software person and this is my personal webpage.

## Blog

The blog index is
[here](https://arcmode.github.io/dist/blog/index.html). It's built with
[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and deployed as [Github
Page](https://pages.github.com/), just like this page.

## My Github Profile

The `Readme.org` file of this repo is deployed as [Github
Profile](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/about-your-profile)
and the `html` version of this page is generated with
[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and deployed as [Github
Page](https://pages.github.com/) [here](https://arcmode.github.io/).
This page is actually that `html` file so you are reading my `Radme`
file :smile:
