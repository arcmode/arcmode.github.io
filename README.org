* Hi there
I'm a software person and this is my personal webpage.

** Blog

The blog index is [[https://arcmode.github.io/dist/blog/index.html][here]]. It's built with [[https://pandoc.org/][Pandoc]] and deployed as [[https://pages.github.com/][Github Page]], just like this page.

** My Github Profile

The =Readme.org= file of this repo is deployed as [[https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/about-your-profile][Github Profile]] and
the =html= version of this page is generated with [[https://pandoc.org/][Pandoc]] and deployed
as [[https://pages.github.com/][Github Page]] [[https://arcmode.github.io/][here]]. This page is actually that =html= file so you are reading
my =Radme= file :smile:
